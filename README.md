# CS-320

When interacting with code, programs and software the ideal is to test as I work through each step. Junits allow you to test specifics, 
if it passes then green, red on the other hand shows errors, although this will help find the location of said error. Using coverage gives me a metric to the code, 
while not necessarily most important this allows me to see how the tests are performing. To maintain security, 
following standards and best practices are ideal, for instance input validation and data encryption.

To understand the user’s needs, I first would need their requirements. 
This is going to be a series of questions that ask them things like:
  
  •	What problem are you trying to solve with this software?
  
  •	 Can you describe the main goals you want to achieve?
  
  •	Who are the primary users of this software, and what are their needs?
 
  •	What are the constraints or limitations we should be aware of?
  
  •	Can you prioritize the requirements from most to least important?
  
  •	How do you envision the software evolving over time?

This is going to paint the picture of what they want and don’t want, throughout this process it will require several meetings to present the different stages of work and in these meeting 
discussions can/will take place for unforeseen changes or things that were planned but may not be working as intended.
The SCRUM method is amazing, and I find that its approach allows for adjustments throughout the development process. 
Each team member is in a very specific role that is easily defined but is a part of the overall process. 
Each member is aware of the requirements, preplanning, design, implementation and the overall goal as well as accountability for both successes and failures. 
I like this approach and would follow it when designing software.
